  <h1>🕯️ The Obituary 🕯️</h1>
  <h2>Where the frags have faded, and the forums echo no more.</h2>

  <div class="obit">
    <h3>🔥 ~PR~ Phoenix Rising (2003–2011)</h3>
    <p>
      Born from the fire of modded Halo maps and faith-driven leadership, Phoenix Rising once lit the skies with red-clad order.<br>
      Died of spiritual fragmentation and mod exhaustion.<br>
      Survived by a few devout members, a locked phpBB3 archive, and scattered memories across Xfire screenshots.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="obit">
    <h3>🎭 «FC» FunHouse Clan (2004–2012)</h3>
    <p>
      A madman's circus of clowns, chaos, and custom maps. Led by the Joker-obsessed admin known as FREEK.<br>
      Collapsed into confetti after internal drama and the disappearance of its ringmaster.<br>
      Survived by [X]Crimson, questionable humor, and some terrifying forum sigs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="obit">
    <h3>🧊 ~QF~ Quantum Fusion (2005–???))</h3>
    <p>
      The tacticians. The quiet storm. Halo modders with military precision.<br>
      Froze in time like a server that never got the restart it needed.<br>
      Still listed as "Active" on someone's Angelfire clan registry.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="obit">
    <h3>🧠 [X] Asylum-X (2008–2009)</h3>
    <p>
      A splinter of the FunHouse asylum, born from modding passion and burnout.<br>
      Last seen trying to lead without caring to. Died of disinterest, realism, and admin fatigue.<br>
      Survived by Duck. Quack once in memory.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="obit">
    <h3>🩸 Syndicate Underground (2010s–Present)</h3>
    <p>
      Not a clan. A crypt. A sanctuary for the forgotten.<br>
      Still glowing faintly in a world that forgot what a killbox was.<br>
      We don’t rise—we <em>persist</em>.
    </p>
